# Multi-Write Storage Guide

This guide explains how to configure multi-write storage in Business Data Platform. Multi-write storage lets one primary backend replicate writes to multiple backup backends for high availability, cross-region replicas, read acceleration, and storage migration.

Multi-write lives inside RAGFS. The Python SDK, HTTP API, and CLI usage remain unchanged.

## Prerequisites

- You already have a working `ov.conf`.
- The primary backend has been verified to read and write correctly.
- If you plan to use S3-compatible storage, prepare the bucket, endpoint, and access credentials first.
- For existing data, follow the [OVPack multi-write migration workflow](./09-ovpack.md#working-with-multi-write-storage); enabling backups alone does not copy historical files.

## Minimal Configuration

The following example uses a local directory as the primary backend and replicates writes to another local directory.

```json
{
  "storage": {
    "workspace": "./data",
    "agfs": {
      "backend": "local",
      "backups": {
        "sync_type": "async",
        "items": [
          {
            "name": "local-backup",
            "backend": "local",
            "local": {
                "workspace": "./data/backup"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:

- The top-level `backend` is the primary backend.
- `backups.items[]` is the backup backend list.
- `name` is the stable identity of a backup; later sync metadata refers to it.
- A backup with `backend = "local"` uses `local.workspace` to point to its local directory.
- If `sync_type` is omitted, treat it as async by default.

## Configuring Multiple Backups

You can configure more than one backup. The following example writes to both a local replica and S3-compatible object storage.

```json
{
  "storage": {
    "workspace": "./data",
    "agfs": {
      "backend": "local",
      "backups": {
        "sync_type": "async",
        "items": [
          {
            "name": "local-az2",
            "backend": "local",
            "local": {
                "workspace": "./data/local-az2"
            }
          },
          {
            "name": "object-store",
            "backend": "s3",
            "s3": {
              "bucket": "openviking-backup",
              "region": "us-east-1",
              "endpoint": "https://s3.example.com",
              "access_key": "your-access-key",
              "secret_key": "your-secret-key",
              "prefix": "openviking",
              "directory_marker_mode": "none"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Recommendations:

- Do not use unstable hostnames or temporary IDs for `name`.
- The backup path or bucket should not point to the same physical location as the primary backend.
- Changing a backup `name` affects historical sync metadata recognition, so treat that as a production change.

### S3-Compatible Storage Notes

When using S3-compatible services (MinIO, RustFS, Ceph, etc.), the `s3` section requires additional fields:

| Field | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `use_path_style` | Yes for most S3-compatible | Set to `true` for path-style URLs (`http://host/bucket/key`). Most S3-compatible services require this. |
| `directory_marker_mode` | Yes for S3-compatible | **Must be explicitly set to `"none"`**. Without this, the RAGFS Rust binding panics with `AGFSConfigError: invalid directory_marker_mode: null` during startup, causing a silent crash loop. |
| `use_ssl` | Optional | Set to `false` for HTTP endpoints (e.g. `http://localhost:9000`). |

**Minimal S3-compatible example (RustFS/MinIO):**

```json
{
  "name": "s3-backup",
  "backend": "s3",
  "s3": {
    "bucket": "my-bucket",
    "endpoint": "http://localhost:9000",
    "access_key": "your-access-key",
    "secret_key": "your-secret-key",
    "prefix": "openviking",
    "use_ssl": false,
    "use_path_style": true,
    "directory_marker_mode": "none"
  }
}
```

> **Why is `directory_marker_mode` required?**
>
> S3-compatible storage services handle "directories" differently from AWS S3. The RAGFS Rust binding must know whether to write directory marker objects when creating directories. Valid values are `"none"`, `"empty"`, and `"nonempty"`. For S3-compatible services that don't use directory markers (RustFS, MinIO, Ceph, etc.), set this to `"none"`. If omitted, the Rust binding defaults to `null` which is rejected, causing the server to crash silently during startup with `AGFSConfigError: invalid directory_marker_mode: null`.

### Docker Networking for S3 Backup

When running Business Data Platform in Docker with an S3 backup on the same host:

- **Linux Docker**: Use `--network host` or the host's LAN IP. Docker bridge network can reach the host's LAN via gateway IP (e.g. `172.17.0.1:9000`).
- **macOS/Windows Docker Desktop**: `--network host` is **not supported** on Docker Desktop. Use `host.docker.internal` as the S3 endpoint (maps to the host's localhost). Alternatively, use the host's LAN IP.

If the server crashes silently on startup with S3 backup enabled, check the Docker networking first. The RAGFS Rust binding will produce `dispatch failure` if the S3 endpoint is unreachable from inside the container.

## Choosing a Sync Mode

### Async Mode

Async mode fits most deployments.

```json
{
  "backups": {
    "sync_type": "async",
    "items": []
  }
}
```

Characteristics:

- Returns immediately after the primary write succeeds.
- Backup writes run in the background.
- Low write latency.
- Backups may lag temporarily.

Suitable for:

- Write throughput first.
- Backups mainly used for disaster recovery.
- Eventual consistency is acceptable.

### Sync Mode

Sync mode waits for backup acknowledgements.

```json
{
  "backups": {
    "sync_type": "sync",
    "write_ack_count": 1,
    "write_ack_timeout_ms": 5000,
    "items": []
  }
}
```

Parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `write_ack_count` | Minimum number of backup acknowledgements required before the write returns |
| `write_ack_timeout_ms` | Timeout in milliseconds while waiting for backup acknowledgements |

Characteristics:

- Stronger write confirmation.
- Write latency depends on backup responsiveness.
- Unconfirmed backups continue to be retried in the background.
- The client may still see an error after the primary write has already succeeded when the required backup acknowledgements are not met.

Suitable for:

- Narrowing the confirmation window between the primary and backups.
- Backup latency is predictable.
- The caller can accept the extra latency of synchronous writes.

## Configuring Read Acceleration

Backups do not participate in reads by default. To let a backup serve reads, explicitly configure `operations`.

```json
{
  "name": "cache-backend",
  "backend": "memfs",
  "operations": [
    {
      "operation": "read",
      "priority": 10
    }
  ]
}
```

Read priority rules:

- Lower `priority` values are tried first.
- Only backups with `read` configured join the read route.
- The primary backend always remains the final fallback.
- Cold-backup nodes usually should not be read-enabled.

If a backup defines only `read` but not `write`, it does not receive normal multi-write replication. Use that only when you explicitly control how the backend gets its data.

## Redirect Configuration

Redirect sends matching files to a specified backup instead of the primary backend.

Redirect by file extension:

```json
{
  "storage": {
    "agfs": {
      "backend": "local",
      "redirects": [
        {
          "type": "FileExtensionPolicy",
          "extensions": ["(pdf|ppt|zip)"],
          "target": ["object-store"]
        }
      ],
      "backups": {
        "items": [
          {
            "name": "object-store",
            "backend": "s3",
            "s3": {
              "bucket": "openviking-large-files",
              "endpoint": "https://s3.example.com"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Redirect by file size:

```json
{
  "type": "FileOverSizePolicy",
  "max_size_mb": 100,
  "target": ["object-store"]
}
```

Notes:

- `target` must reference an existing backup `name`.
- Redirected files still appear as normal readable, listable, and queryable files through the public APIs.
- Redirect mappings are stored in internal metadata on the primary backend.

## Exclude Configuration

Exclude makes one backup skip matching files.

```json
{
  "name": "cache-backend",
  "backend": "memfs",
  "excludes": [
    {
      "type": "FileOverSizePolicy",
      "max_size_mb": 50
    },
    {
      "type": "FileExtensionPolicy",
      "extensions": ["(mp4|zip)"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Common uses:

- Exclude large files from cache backends.
- Exclude file types that do not need to be preserved on a lower-cost backup.
- Keep one backup focused on text or configuration resources only.

If the target backup of a redirect also excludes the same file, the configuration is self-contradictory. Fix the configuration instead of expecting the system to guess another target.

## Encryption Configuration

Multi-write storage reuses Business Data Platform's transparent at-rest encryption.

Example with global encryption enabled:

```json
{
  "encryption": {
    "enabled": true,
    "provider": "local",
    "local": {
      "key_file": "~/.openviking/master.key"
    }
  },
  "storage": {
    "workspace": "./data",
    "agfs": {
      "backend": "local",
      "backups": {
        "items": [
          {
            "name": "plain-cache",
            "backend": "memfs",
            "encryption": {
              "enabled": false
            }
          },
          {
            "name": "encrypted-backup",
            "backend": "local",
            "local": {
                "workspace": "./data/encrypted-backup"
            },
            "encryption": {
              "enabled": true
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Rules:

- When global `encryption.enabled=true`, the primary backend must be encrypted.
- Each backup may independently control encryption through `encryption.enabled`.
- The Python SDK, HTTP API, and CLI do not need to handle encryption or decryption.
- Internal metadata such as `.redirect.json` and `.sync_log.json` follows the primary backend's encryption policy.

## Migrating Existing Data

Multi-write only replicates writes that happen after it is enabled. It does not automatically copy historical files.

For OVPack migration, follow [Working with Multi-Write Storage](./09-ovpack.md#working-with-multi-write-storage): configure multi-write on the clean target before restoring through that server, then verify each replica before resuming writes. That guide also covers target account initialization and restore conflict handling.

## Verifying the Configuration

Before startup, it is recommended to run:

```bash
openviking-server doctor
```

After startup, verify with ordinary file APIs:

```bash
openviking write viking://resources/multiwrite-check.txt \
  --content "multi-write check"

openviking read viking://resources/multiwrite-check.txt
```

If you use a local backup, you can also inspect the backup directory directly. In production, system health checks and sync-status commands are preferable.

## FAQ

### Why is a backup not serving reads?

Backups are write-only by default. To make a backup serve reads, configure:

```json
{
  "operations": [
    {
      "operation": "read",
      "priority": 10
    }
  ]
}
```

### Why do historical files not appear in the backup after enabling multi-write?

Multi-write only handles new writes after it is enabled. For historical data, follow the [OVPack migration workflow](./09-ovpack.md#working-with-multi-write-storage); enabling backups does not backfill it.

### Can async mode guarantee that the newest data is immediately readable from a backup?

No. Async mode provides eventual consistency only. If you need stronger read consistency, let reads fall back to the primary backend or avoid routing reads to backups that may lag.

### Will internal metadata files appear in normal user listings?

No. `.redirect.json` and `.sync_log.json` are internal files and are hidden from ordinary directory listings.

### If sync mode returns a failure, does that mean the primary backend definitely did not write the data?

No. The primary write may already have succeeded while the required backup acknowledgements were not met. In that case the client can see a failure even though the data already exists on the primary backend, and lagging backups will continue to be repaired in the background.
