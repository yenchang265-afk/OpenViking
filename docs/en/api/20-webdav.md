# WebDAV

WebDAV provides file-protocol access to the `resources` namespace.

**Code entry point**: `openviking/server/routers/webdav.py`

## WebDAV (Phase 1)

Business Data Platform Server also exposes a minimal WebDAV adapter for resource files:

```text
/webdav/resources
```

Phase 1 intentionally keeps the scope narrow:

- Resources only. Memories, skills, sessions, and other namespaces are not exposed.
- Text-first writes. `PUT` currently accepts UTF-8 text content only.
- WebDAV subset only. `OPTIONS`, `PROPFIND`, `GET`, `HEAD`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `MKCOL`, and `MOVE` are supported.
- Semantic sidecars and internal system files stay internal. Derived or internal files such as `.abstract.md`, `.overview.md`, `.path.ovlock`, `.redirect.json`, and `.sync_log.json` are hidden from listings and cannot be accessed directly through WebDAV.

Behavior notes:

- Creating a new file through WebDAV triggers Business Data Platform semantic generation for that file path.
- Replacing an existing file through WebDAV refreshes related semantics and vectors, same as `write()`.
- `PUT` does not create parent collections automatically. Create missing directories with `MKCOL` first.
- User-created dot-directories and dot-files remain visible unless they match one of the reserved internal filenames above.
- When multi-write storage is enabled, files redirected to a backup are still exposed through the filesystem APIs as normal files; internal redirect and sync metadata never become visible to callers.

## API Reference

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `OPTIONS` | `/webdav/resources`, `/webdav/resources/{resource_path}` | Return supported methods and DAV version |
| `PROPFIND` | `/webdav/resources`, `/webdav/resources/{resource_path}` | Return properties for the target and immediate children |
| `GET` / `HEAD` | `/webdav/resources`, `/webdav/resources/{resource_path}` | Read file content or headers |
| `PUT` | `/webdav/resources`, `/webdav/resources/{resource_path}` | Create or overwrite a UTF-8 text file |
| `DELETE` | `/webdav/resources`, `/webdav/resources/{resource_path}` | Delete a file or recursively delete a directory |
| `MKCOL` | `/webdav/resources`, `/webdav/resources/{resource_path}` | Create a directory |
| `MOVE` | `/webdav/resources`, `/webdav/resources/{resource_path}` | Move or rename a file or directory |

Except for `OPTIONS`, WebDAV requests use the same authentication headers as other Business Data Platform APIs. Paths must remain under `resources` and cannot escape through `..`, backslashes, or equivalent forms.

| Header | Methods | Required | Description |
|--------|---------|----------|-------------|
| `X-API-Key` | All except `OPTIONS` | Yes | Business Data Platform API key |
| `Depth` | `PROPFIND` | No | `0` returns only the target; other values use one level |
| `Destination` | `MOVE` | Yes | Target path below `/webdav/resources` |
| `Overwrite` | `MOVE` | No | Defaults to `T`; set `F` to preserve an existing target |

### List a collection

`Depth` supports `0` and one level; other values are treated as one level. A successful response is `207 Multi-Status` with DAV XML.

**HTTP API**

```bash
curl -X PROPFIND http://localhost:1933/webdav/resources/docs \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-key" \
  -H "Depth: 1"
```

**Response Example**

```xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<d:multistatus xmlns:d="DAV:">
  <d:response>
    <d:href>/webdav/resources/docs/</d:href>
    <d:propstat>
      <d:prop>
        <d:displayname>docs</d:displayname>
        <d:resourcetype><d:collection /></d:resourcetype>
        <d:getcontenttype>httpd/unix-directory</d:getcontenttype>
      </d:prop>
      <d:status>HTTP/1.1 200 OK</d:status>
    </d:propstat>
  </d:response>
</d:multistatus>
```

### Read and write files

`PUT` does not create parent directories. File creation returns `201`, replacement returns `204`, and non-UTF-8 content returns `415`.

**HTTP API**

```bash
curl http://localhost:1933/webdav/resources/docs/readme.md \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-key"
```

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:1933/webdav/resources/docs/readme.md \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8" \
  --data-binary @README.md
```

### Create, move, and delete

`MOVE` requires a `Destination` header whose value remains under `/webdav/resources`. The destination parent directory must already exist.

**HTTP API**

```bash
curl -X MKCOL http://localhost:1933/webdav/resources/archive \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-key"
```

```bash
curl -X MOVE http://localhost:1933/webdav/resources/docs/readme.md \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-key" \
  -H "Destination: /webdav/resources/archive/readme.md"
```

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:1933/webdav/resources/archive \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-key"
```

**Status Codes**

| Operation | Success | Common failures |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| `GET` / `HEAD` | `200` | `404` missing; `405` target is a directory |
| `PUT` | `201` create; `204` overwrite | `409` parent missing; `415` body is not UTF-8 |
| `MKCOL` | `201` | `405` already exists; `409` parent missing |
| `MOVE` | `201` new target; `204` overwrite | `400` destination missing; `409` destination parent missing; `412` overwrite disabled |
| `DELETE` | `204` | `404` missing; `405` resources root cannot be deleted |

WebDAV is a protocol entry point rather than a Business Data Platform SDK or `ov` CLI surface, so this page shows only the HTTP tab. Use [File System](03-filesystem.md) for SDK and CLI file operations.
