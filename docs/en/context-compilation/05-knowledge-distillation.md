# Example: Knowledge Distillation

**Distill** one or more knowledge bases or document collections into topic-organized, evidence-grounded high-level knowledge: cross-source findings, trends, changes, drivers, comparisons, implications, and uncertainties.

Typical uses: distill a knowledge base, compare multiple collections, or derive higher-order insights such as "changes across financial reports."

The output is a shallow, topic-organized artifact tree where each topic directory is a durable semantic area and each page is one independently useful high-level conclusion:

```text
revenue-quality/
  growth-shifted-from-volume-to-pricing.md
  overseas-growth-offset-domestic-slowdown.md
profitability/
  margin-recovered-but-cash-conversion-weakened.md
risk/
  customer-concentration-increased.md
```

> This is a shape example only — the real topics and findings come from the domain you supply. Note that page names state the **conclusion itself** (`growth-shifted-from-volume-to-pricing`), not a source title (`q2-report-summary`).

Skill source: [openviking/builtin_skills/compile/knowledge-distillation](https://github.com/yenchang265-afk/OpenViking/tree/main/openviking/builtin_skills/compile/knowledge-distillation)

## Step 1: Prepare the sources

```bash
ov add-resource ./finance-reports --to viking://resources/finance-reports
ov ls -r viking://resources/finance-reports
```

## Step 2: Add the Skill

The Knowledge Distillation Skill ships with OpenViking and is installed into every account's shared `viking://agent/skills` by default (server option `server.builtin_skills`). Check that it is there:

```bash
ov skills list
# → viking://agent/skills/knowledge-distillation
```

If an admin removed it, add it back from the package source:

```bash
ov add-skill openviking/builtin_skills/compile/knowledge-distillation -p viking://agent/skills
```

## Step 3: Run compile

Spell out the **analytical question, comparison dimensions, baseline, and scope** in `--instruction` — it directly sets the direction of the distillation:

```bash
ov compile \
  --from viking://resources/finance-reports \
  --to viking://resources/finance-insights \
  --skill viking://agent/skills/knowledge-distillation \
  --instruction "Compare the last three years of reports; obtain changes and drivers in revenue quality, profitability, and risk"
```

`--from` accepts multiple sources for cross-knowledge-base comparison:

```bash
ov compile \
  --from viking://resources/finance-2024,viking://resources/finance-2025 \
  --to viking://resources/finance-insights \
  --skill viking://agent/skills/knowledge-distillation \
  --instruction "Compare the two yearly knowledge bases; surface changes and structural differences in key metrics"
```

The command returns a `task_id` immediately:

```bash
ov task status cmp_01abc      # progress and final result
ov task cancel cmp_01abc      # cooperative cancel
```

## Step 4: Inspect the output

Read the topic tree first, then drill into a specific conclusion page:

```bash
ov tree viking://resources/finance-insights
ov read viking://resources/finance-insights/revenue-quality/growth-shifted-from-volume-to-pricing.md
```

By default **no `index.md` is created** — a distillation is itself a set of conclusions, unless `--instruction` explicitly asks for a navigation page. Re-running refreshes the same analysis page and time-bounds any conclusion that may change.
