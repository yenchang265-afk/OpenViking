# Resource Access Control (ACL)

Business Data Platform ACL shares directories or files from the shared resource scope with users or groups inside one account. ACL never changes the account boundary: every grant is limited to the current account.

ACL uses a collaborative-document inheritance model. A directory grant applies to descendants by default. Child directories and files can add direct grants or establish a restricted boundary that ignores inherited permissions.

## Supported URIs

ACL applies only to shared resources:

```text
viking://resources/...
```

- An account `ADMIN` implicitly has `manage` on `viking://resources/...`.
- `viking://resources` has a fixed, immutable `user:* = manage` ACL. Descendants inherit it until a restricted boundary.
- `viking://user/{user_id}/resources/...` is private and does not accept ACLs. To share it, move the resource into a writable shared directory and inherit that directory's ACL.

Implicit management is not stored as an ACL entry and cannot be removed by ACL changes. It ensures that shared resources always have an identity that can establish or recover permissions.

## Principals and Levels

ACL entries use typed principals:

- `user:{user_id}`: a user in the current account.
- `group:{group_id}`: a caller-supplied, account-unique group ID.
- `user:*`: any user in the current account.

`group:*` is not supported. Groups are flat. Membership changes do not rewrite resource ACL or context records; they take effect when the next request builds `RequestContext.group_ids`.
Asynchronous parse and semantic tasks created by a request carry the same group identity. After an `add-resource` destination write has been authorized, automatic semantic maintenance preserves that identity and uses an explicit internal ACL bypass instead of changing the caller's role.

| Level | Allowed operations |
|-------|--------------------|
| `read` | Read, list, and `find/search/grep` |
| `write` | `read` capabilities plus write, create, file delete/move, and tag updates |
| `manage` | `write` capabilities plus directory delete/move and ACL management |

Each higher level includes the lower levels. A `manage` grant therefore includes `read` and `write`.

## Inheritance

A normal node combines direct and inherited grants. A restricted node uses only direct grants:

```text
effective(node) = direct(node) + (acl_mode(node) == "restricted" ? empty : inherited(node))
```

`inherited(node)` always stores the parent's current effective permissions. It continues to refresh while the node is restricted, and disabling restricted mode applies the latest inherited value immediately. Descendants inherit the current node's effective permissions, so they cannot bypass an intermediate restricted boundary.

For example, first make `A` restricted to cut off the root wildcard grant, then configure:

```text
read user:bob   on viking://resources/A
write group:engineering on viking://resources/A/B
read user:carol on viking://resources/A/B/C/report.md
```

The effective permissions on `report.md` are:

- Bob: `read`
- Members of `engineering`: `write`
- Carol: `read`

If `A/B` becomes restricted, Bob's grant on `A` no longer applies to `A/B` or its descendants, but the stored inherited value is not deleted. Disabling restricted mode immediately restores Bob's inherited access.

## Default Behavior and `acl_mode`

The account-level `acl.enabled` setting is disabled by default. While disabled,
shared resources keep the existing URI namespace visibility and write rules.
ACL is not enforced. Indexed content still stores ACL fields using the same inheritance rules; the switch only controls access checks and retrieval filtering.

When enabled, the root grants `user:* = manage`, so all account members can
manage shared content that continues to inherit from the root. Without `acl`, new nodes have
empty direct ACLs and inherit their parent’s effective permissions. Creating
content grants no additional permissions. Import roots and descendants follow
the same rule. Existing shared content without ACL fields uses default
inheritance without a historical data migration. Disabling the setting stops
enforcing existing ACLs. Re-embedding or replacing an existing context record
does not change its direct ACL unless explicitly supplied. See [ACL API](../api/12-acl.md) for creation parameters.

`acl_mode` describes a resource's ACL behavior, separately from the account-wide `acl.enabled` switch:

- `none`: ACL fields have not been materialized; shared nodes use default inheritance when ACL is enabled.
- `inherit`: use direct grants and permissions inherited from the parent.
- `restricted`: use direct grants only, while retaining and refreshing inherited grants.

Users with `manage` can switch between `inherit` and `restricted`, but cannot set `none` to bypass the parent's ACL. Exiting restricted mode restores parent inheritance; all account members regain `manage` when no other restricted boundary interrupts the path to the root. A restricted node with no direct grants remains protected, as do descendants without separate grants; account administrators retain implicit management access.

## File Operations

All filesystem APIs use the same permission mapping:

| Operation | Required capability |
|-----------|---------------------|
| read, stat, list, tree, find, search, grep, glob | read |
| write, create, mkdir, set tags | write |
| delete or move a file | write |
| delete or move a directory | manage on the directory and complete subtree |
| manage ACL | manage |
| move destination parent | write |

The server canonicalizes the URI, then uses one authorization entry point for account/owner/actor-peer boundaries, effective ACLs when enabled or existing namespace rules when disabled, and write/delete namespace guards.

When the account enables `acl.enabled`, ordinary shared nodes inherit the root’s
`user:* = manage` grant, allowing members to manage their ACLs. Creating content
inside a restricted directory only inherits the parent’s permissions.

An ACL grant on a directory is inherited by every descendant. `list`, `tree`, and other batch results still check every returned node because an open directory can contain independently restricted descendants.

Within the shared scope, a moved node keeps its direct ACL and restricted state, then recalculates inherited permissions from its new parent. A private resource moved into the shared scope carries no ACL and inherits the destination directory; a shared resource moved back to a private area has its ACL cleared.

Recursive tag updates, directory deletion, and directory moves validate the complete affected subtree first. The operation stops if any node lacks the required capability or the subtree cannot be scanned completely.

For a directory, `stat.count` uses the same path and ACL scalar filter and reports the number of context records visible to the caller.

## Retrieval Filtering

ACL data exists only in the context collection. Each context record stores direct and inherited permissions in native scalar fields:

```text
acl_mode
acl_direct_grants
acl_inherited_grants
```

`acl_direct_grants` is the ACL assigned to the current node. `acl_inherited_grants` stores the parent's current effective ACL. `acl_mode` controls whether inherited grants contribute to the current node's effective permissions. Each principal stores only its highest level as `{mask}:{principal}`: `1` means `read`, `3` means `write`, and `7` means `manage`. There is no separate ACL collection.

ACLs update with the index, so records for the same URI may temporarily hold different versions. Reads use one ACL snapshot returned by the index, without merging grants across versions or blocking on temporary disagreement. Permission changes take effect as index updates complete; strong consistency is not guaranteed.

The request principals are `user:{ctx.user_id}`, `user:*`, and one `group:{group_id}` for each ID in `ctx.group_ids`. Within the shared scope, retrieval identifies controlled records with `acl_mode IN [inherit, restricted]`, then matches each principal's `1`, `3`, and `7` grant tokens: direct or inherited for inherit mode, direct only for restricted mode. Shared records with missing, `null`, or `none` modes use the root’s default wildcard access in retrieval. Stored inherit nodes must match their direct or inherited grants; inherit mode alone never grants wildcard access. Private resources remain isolated by URI owner.

A retrieval target URI is only a search scope; the caller does not need to read the target node itself. A user can discover a deeply shared file even when intermediate directories are not readable.

When the account enables `acl.enabled`, shared-scope context writes preserve an
existing direct ACL for the same URI. New nodes have empty direct ACLs and
derive inherited ACL fields from their parent, including `7:user:*` when no
restricted boundary intervenes. Creator identity does not affect authorization.
Re-embedding and ordinary replacement writes cannot reset controlled records to
default visibility or modify ACLs through regular context fields. When the
account disables the switch, retrieval uses only the original account and URI
scope filters and ignores these ACL fields.

## Example

Assume `project-a` is already restricted and the caller has `manage` on it.
Grant Bob read-only access to the directory:

```bash
ov acl grant viking://resources/project-a --principal user:bob --level read
```

Bob can read and retrieve descendants, but cannot write or delete them. Upgrade the grant to `write`:

```bash
ov acl grant viking://resources/project-a --principal user:bob --level write
```

Remove Bob's direct grant from this node:

```bash
ov acl revoke viking://resources/project-a --principal user:bob
```

If an ancestor still grants Bob access, that inherited permission remains effective.

Use only direct grants on the current node while preserving and refreshing inherited grants:

```bash
ov acl set viking://resources/project-a --acl-mode restricted
```
