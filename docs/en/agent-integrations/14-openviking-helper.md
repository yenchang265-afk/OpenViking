# Business Data Platform Helper

Business Data Platform Helper is a desktop console for local coding agents. It brings Business Data Platform setup that would otherwise be spread across commands, configuration files, and installation scripts into one interface, together with session inspection and local memory and skill management.

Helper does not replace the Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, TRAE, or OpenCode integrations. It uses the same Business Data Platform configuration to install them, check their status, and show whether Business Data Platform is actually active in a session.

Business Data Platform Helper is currently in beta and supports macOS and Windows x64. The application UI is available in English and Chinese; switch languages at any time under **Settings → General → Display Language**.

## Get started

1. Download and launch the package that matches your platform and architecture.
2. Open **Settings → Configuration**, select Volcengine Cloud or a self-hosted Business Data Platform service, enter the connection details, and test the connection.
3. Open **Settings → Agent Integration**. Helper detects the Business Data Platform CLI, Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, TRAE, and OpenCode on your machine.
4. Install or configure the plugin, MCP server, Hook, or CLI integration for each agent you want to use, then restart the agent when prompted.
5. Use the **Sessions**, **Memory**, and **Skills** pages to inspect the integration and local data.

## Set up agents visually

Helper detects installed local agents and displays their Business Data Platform integration status. From the UI, you can maintain multiple Business Data Platform service profiles, switch the active profile, test connectivity, and install or repair supported agent integrations.

The exact capabilities still depend on each agent integration. Refer to the corresponding integration guide for lifecycle Hooks, MCP tools, and automatic recall behavior in Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, TRAE, and OpenCode.

## Inspect session traces

Helper parses local Claude Code, Codex, and TRAE sessions and groups their timelines by agent and project. Session details show important Business Data Platform activity, including whether:

- memory recall and context injection ran before a prompt;
- the session called a Business Data Platform MCP tool;
- new conversation turns were captured after a response;
- the session was committed before context compaction;
- lifecycle actions ran at session start or end.

This makes it easier to verify that an integration is working and to diagnose configuration, Hook, or MCP connection problems.

## Manage memories and skills

Helper groups local memory and rule files and `SKILL.md` skills by agent and project. You can inspect their content, path, modification time, and sync status, then sync selected local content to the active Business Data Platform service.

After syncing, you can browse the server-side memory categories and content from Helper. Long-term information that was previously scattered across agents can then be searched and reused through Business Data Platform.

## Local data and privacy

Helper reads the relevant local agent configuration and data to display integration status, sessions, and memories. Content is sent to the active Business Data Platform service only when you sync it or use a service-backed capability. Before syncing, confirm the service address and review the selected content for sensitive information.
