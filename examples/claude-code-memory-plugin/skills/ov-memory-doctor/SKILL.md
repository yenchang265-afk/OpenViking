  Diagnose and fix the OpenViking memory plugin on this machine: the plugin
  install (enablement, hooks, MCP server), the client configuration
  (ovcli.conf / ov.conf / OPENVIKING_* env) and the connection to the
  OpenViking server (reachability, 401/403, /mcp). Use whenever memory "isn't
  working": no <openviking-context> block, empty recall, captures not landing,
  missing or failing MCP memory tools, 401/403, an offline statusline, right
  after installing/updating the plugin or switching servers/keys, or when the
  user asks for the plugin's status. Triggers: "memory not working", "check
  OpenViking", "plugin status", "記憶沒生效", "外掛狀態", "連不上 OpenViking",
  "recall 為空", "401".

# OpenViking Memory Doctor

Client-side troubleshooting for the OpenViking memory plugin. The plugin has
three moving parts and each fails silently in its own way:

- **Install** — marketplace registration, plugin enablement, the nine hooks,
  the stdio MCP proxy. When these are wrong, hooks never run and nothing is
  logged anywhere.
- **Configuration** — `~/.openviking/ovcli.conf`, `~/.openviking/ov.conf`
  and `OPENVIKING_*` environment variables, resolved as env → ovcli.conf →
  ov.conf → defaults. A malformed file reads as "no config", which silently
  disables the plugin; a stray env var silently overrides the file.
- **Connection** — on a self-hosted server `/health` answers 200 even with a
  bad key, so the statusline can be green while every real request 401s. On
  OpenViking Cloud the gateway authenticates `/health` and `/ready` too, so
  the same probe answers 401 without a key and says nothing about the url.

When the resolved url is loopback, the server runs on this machine and the
doctor adds a **Server health** section: whether anything listens on the
port, plugin-only keys in `ov.conf` (a top-level block named after any
harness: `claude_code`, `codex`, `cursor`, `trae`, `trae_cn`, `zcode`,
`opencode`, `dsh`, `pi`, plus `server.url`) that make the server refuse to
start, and `GET /ready` — the server's own
per-subsystem verdict (agfs, vectordb, api keys, embedding, ollama). For a
remote server only `/ready` is probed. Everything else on the server side —
config validation, live embedding probe, native engine, disk — is
`openviking-server doctor`, run in the server's Python environment.

## Step 1 — run the doctor

```bash
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/ov-memory-doctor.mjs
```

Options: `--json` (machine-readable), `--offline` (skip network probes),
`--timeout <ms>` (per probe, default 5000), `--no-color`.

The report has six sections — Environment, Plugin install, Configuration,
Connection, Server health, Recent activity — and a Summary listing every ✗/⚠
with a fix.
Read the whole report before acting: a single root cause usually shows up in
several sections (for example a bad key → "api key rejected" + "system/status
→ 401" + `turns_failed > 0`).

If the report says "this script is not running from the registered install",
rerun it from the path it prints — Claude Code executes hooks from that copy.

The API key is never printed in full. Three-segment keys are shown as
`account=<a> user=<u> secret=abcd…wxyz` (the first two segments are just
base64url identity, decoded so the user can see which account/user the key
claims); legacy keys as `abcd…wxyz (64 chars)`. Keep it that way in anything
you show the user.

## Step 2 — map findings to causes

Work top-down; fix the first ✗ and rerun before chasing the next.

| Doctor finding | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `plugin disabled — every hook exits immediately` | No parseable config, `OPENVIKING_MEMORY_ENABLED=0`, or `claude_code.enabled: false` in ov.conf | Fix the reason it names. Fresh machine: create `~/.openviking/ovcli.conf` with `url` + `api_key` (`chmod 600`). |
| `ovcli.conf cannot be parsed` | Trailing comma/comment; the plugin treats the file as absent | Fix the JSON. This is the most common "installed but nothing happens". |
| `not registered in installed_plugins.json` / `claude plugin list does not show …` | Plugin never installed, or installed under an old id | Re-run the one-line installer (`bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/volcengine/OpenViking/main/examples/memory-plugin-shared/install.sh) --harness claude`; add `--dist tos` where GitHub is blocked). |
| `plugin is disabled in ~/.claude/settings.json` | Installed but `enabledPlugins` is false/missing | `claude plugin enable openviking-memory@openviking`, restart Claude Code. |
| `marketplace 'openviking' … missing directory` / registered as a file | The checkout/archive moved, or a file-type marketplace (fails `marketplace update` with EISDIR) | `claude plugin marketplace remove openviking` then re-run the installer. |
| `no skills/ directory in this plugin copy` / registered version behind the repo | Stale version-keyed cache; `claude plugin update` is a no-op when the version string did not change | `claude plugin marketplace update openviking && claude plugin uninstall openviking-memory@openviking && claude plugin install openviking-memory@openviking`. |
| `legacy openviking hooks … settings.json` / extra plugin ids / user-scope MCP `openviking` | Pre-2.0 install residue; every hook fires twice, MCP server registered twice | Remove the openviking entries from `.hooks` in `~/.claude/settings.json` (back it up), `claude plugin uninstall <stale id>`, `claude mcp remove openviking -s user`. |
| `node is not on PATH` / node < 18 | Hooks and `.mcp.json` run the bare command `node`; GUI/IDE launches often lack nvm/volta shims | Put node on PATH for the launching environment, or set `PATH` in the `env` block of `~/.claude/settings.json`. |
| `server unreachable` (refused / dns / timeout / tls) | Wrong url/port, server down, DNS/VPN, private CA | Compare with `curl -sS <url>/health`. curl OK + doctor fails ⇒ proxy or CA issue (see Step 3). |
| `base URL ends with /api/v1` or `/mcp`, no scheme, `GET /health → 404` | url shape wrong (paths are concatenated bare); Cloud needs the `/openviking` prefix | Fix `url` to the API root. |
| `/health is authenticated at this deployment` (info) / `api key rejected on /health → 401` | OpenViking Cloud gates `/health` and `/ready` at the gateway, so the probe without a key 401s and says nothing about the url | The info line needs no fix — the report reads /health with the key instead. The ✗ means the gateway rejected this key: use one issued for that deployment (Cloud keys come from the Volcengine console). |
| `api key rejected` (200 from /health with no identity) then `system/status → 401 Invalid API Key` | Key invalid/revoked/for another deployment. A 3-segment key for a non-existent account looks identical. | Get the key re-issued; check no env var shadows ovcli.conf ("← env" in the Configuration section). |
| `using the ROOT api key` / `403 ROOT API keys cannot access tenant-scoped data APIs` | `api_key` fell through to `ov.conf server.root_api_key`, or the user pasted the root key | Create a user key (`POST /api/v1/admin/accounts/<account>/users` with the root key) and put it in ovcli.conf. |
| `server is in trusted mode and needs account + user` / 400 `Trusted mode requests must include…` | Server identity comes from headers | Set `account` and `user` in ovcli.conf. |
| `configured account/user differ from the key's identity` | In `api_key` mode the server ignores `X-OpenViking-Account/User`; data lands under the key's identity | Remove them or use a key for that identity. Explains "I changed the account but nothing changed". |
| `request/capture timeout exceeds the hook budget` | Claude Code kills the hook before the request finishes | Lower `OPENVIKING_TIMEOUT_MS` / `OPENVIKING_CAPTURE_TIMEOUT_MS`. |
| `POST /mcp tools/list → 404/406/502/504` while /health is fine | Reverse proxy not forwarding `/mcp`, rewriting `Accept`, or buffering SSE | Fix the proxy (`proxy_buffering off`, forward `/mcp`, pass `Authorization`). |
| `proxy variables set` + curl works but doctor/hook fails | Node's fetch ignores `HTTP(S)_PROXY`; the plugin ships no proxy/CA handling | `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1` or `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=<ca.pem>` in the environment that launches Claude Code (`env` block of `~/.claude/settings.json`). |
| `last auto-recall … reason=offline/bypass/disabled/short_query` | The hook ran and chose not to inject | `offline` → connection; `bypass` → `OPENVIKING_BYPASS_SESSION*`; `short_query` → prompt shorter than `minQueryLength`; only `no_results`/`filtered_out` mean the search actually ran. Note that a 401 on the search call also reads as `no_results`. |
| `turns_failed > 0` / `capture payload(s) waiting` | Writes rejected (401/403/404 are dropped, not queued) or server was down (queued, replayed at next SessionStart) | Fix credentials/connection; `OPENVIKING_WRITE_PATH_ASYNC=0` makes the error visible on stderr. |
| `MCP proxy last started against <other url>` | The proxy is a long-lived process; a changed url only takes effect after restart | Restart Claude Code or `/mcp` → reconnect. Key rotation self-heals after a 401 if ovcli.conf changed on disk. |
| `recall is pinned to the legacy /search/recall endpoint` | One 4xx mentioning "mode" pins recall for 6h | `rm ~/.openviking/state/context-face.json`. |
| `no hook log … debug is on but no hook has run` | Hooks are not being spawned at all | Registration/enablement/node problem, not a server problem. |
| `ov.conf has a top-level '<harness>' block` / `server.url is rejected` | Plugin-only keys in the server's own config — a top-level block named after any harness (`claude_code`, `codex`, `cursor`, `trae`, `trae_cn`, `zcode`, `opencode`, `dsh`, `pi`) plus `server.url`; the server refuses to start at its next restart (`Unknown config field` / `Extra inputs are not permitted`) | Move them to ovcli.conf (`plugin.<harness>`, `url`) and delete them from ov.conf. Ignore only if this ov.conf never starts a server. |
| `nothing listens on port … — the server is not running` | Server down or never started; the presence of `.openviking.lock` does not indicate whether the server is running | Start it (`openviking-server`; first time `openviking-server init`) in a terminal and read the startup output. Ask before restarting a server the user runs. |
| `/ready: embedding → error …` | The running server cannot call its embedding provider: recall searches nothing, commits extract nothing | Fix `embedding.*` (api_key/api_base/model) in ov.conf and restart; `openviking-server doctor` prints the provider's reply. |
| `/ready: vectordb → …` / `/ready: agfs → …` | Storage broken: disk full, two servers on one workspace, corrupted index | Server log; stop the duplicate; free disk. |
| `server is still initializing (503 /ready)` | First start downloads a local embedding model, or init is slow | Wait and rerun; if it never finishes, the server log. |
| `docker container is up but has no ov.conf` | Official image started without a config mount (every request 503s) | Mount `~/.openviking` at `/app/.openviking`, or `docker exec -it openviking openviking-server init`. |

## Step 3 — targeted checks (only when the report is not conclusive)

Prove hooks run at all. `OPENVIKING_DEBUG=1` must reach Claude Code's own
process — a shell export does not, the `env` block in `~/.claude/settings.json`
does. Then send one prompt in a new session and read
`~/.openviking/logs/cc-hooks.log` (JSONL; grep `"error"` and
`"hook":"mcp-proxy","stage":"start"`). A `subagent-stop transcript_read ENOENT`
line is harmless noise.

Prove the key and identity by hand (`Bearer` is case-sensitive with exactly one
space):

```bash
URL=<url>; KEY=<key>
curl -sS "$URL/health"                                  # reachability, version, auth_mode (401 on Cloud: the gateway gates /health)
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" "$URL/health"  # 200 without account_id/user_id/role ⇒ key invalid
curl -sS -w '\n%{http_code}\n' -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" "$URL/api/v1/system/status"  # real 401/403
```

Prove `/mcp` directly (stateless — no initialize needed):

```bash
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -X POST "$URL/mcp" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
```

Prove Claude Code's MCP wiring: `claude mcp list` (slow, 30–60s) must show
`plugin:openviking-memory:openviking: node <installPath>/servers/mcp-proxy.mjs - ✔ Connected`;
`claude mcp get 'plugin:openviking-memory:openviking'` needs the full quoted
name. `/mcp` inside a session reconnects the proxy.

Prove a capture landed: take `ov_session_id` from
`~/.openviking/state/last-capture.json` and `GET $URL/api/v1/sessions/<id>`
(or `ov session get <id>`); `total_message_count` should be ≥ the captured
turns, `commit_count > 0` proves extraction ran.

Second opinion from the CLI: `ov health` and `ov config validate` read the
same `~/.openviking/ovcli.conf` (they show account/user/role for the key).
`ov config list` reveals whether a different profile was switched in with
`ov config switch` — that also retargets the plugin.

Server side (only meaningful when the server runs on this machine):

```bash
curl -sS "$URL/ready"                       # agfs / vectordb / api_key_manager / embedding (live probe, ≤10s) / ollama
openviking-server doctor                    # in the server's own environment: config, native engine, embedding probe, VLM key, disk
lsof -nP -iTCP:1933 -sTCP:LISTEN            # who owns the port
docker logs --tail 100 openviking           # container deployments
```

`log.output` defaults to stdout, so the server log is the terminal/tmux pane
it runs in, the nohup file, `journalctl -u openviking`, or `docker logs`;
with `"file"` it is `<storage.workspace>/log/openviking.log`. A server that
exits at startup prints the reason right there — running `openviking-server`
in the foreground is the quickest way to see it. It is the user's process:
ask before stopping or restarting it.

## Fixing

- Edit `~/.openviking/ovcli.conf` only with the user's agreement; show the
  change, keep unknown keys, keep mode 0600, never echo the key.
- Prefer env vars in the `env` block of `~/.claude/settings.json` for
  machine-wide overrides; a shell rc export only reaches sessions started from
  that shell and silently outranks the file everywhere.
- After changing `url`, installing or updating the plugin: restart Claude
  Code. Hooks re-read config per invocation, the MCP proxy does not.
- Updates: GitHub installs → `claude plugin marketplace update openviking && claude plugin update openviking-memory@openviking`;
  TOS/archive and dev-checkout installs → re-run the installer.
- Confirm the fix by rerunning the doctor, then by observing an
  `<openviking-context>` block on the next prompt.

## Documentation

- Source and issues: <https://github.com/volcengine/OpenViking> — plugin code lives under `examples/`, the shared installer under `examples/memory-plugin-shared/`.
- Documentation index (LLM-friendly): <https://docs.openviking.ai/llms.txt>; the harness integration pages under it cover install paths, configuration keys and known limitations.
- `https://api.vikingdb.cn-beijing.volces.com/openviking` is the Volcengine-hosted OpenViking Service (OpenViking Cloud): the path prefix is part of the base url, it accepts `Authorization: Bearer` only, and its keys are issued from the Volcengine console rather than by a self-hosted admin.

## Rules

- Never print a full API key or the raw contents of `ovcli.conf`; the
  doctor's masked forms are the limit.
- `scripts/setup.mjs` needs a TTY and, on older plugin versions, an existing
  `ovcli.conf`; on a fresh machine write the file directly or re-run the installer.
- Never pipe `claude plugin list` into `grep -q`; capture the output first
  (early exit under `pipefail` reads as "not installed").
- `/health` returning 200 proves reachability only. Auth is proven by the
  identity fields with a key, or by `/api/v1/system/status`.
- `ov doctor` is `openviking-server doctor`: it validates the server's own
  config and providers in the server's Python environment, makes a live
  embedding call, and says nothing about this plugin. Run it for provider-level
  failures, not first.
- The doctor only reads. Never stop, restart or `kill` the user's server, or
  edit `ov.conf`, without asking.
- Older proxy versions say "check that 'ov serve' is running" — there is no
  such command; the server is started with `openviking-server`.
- `OPENVIKING_MEMORY_ENABLED=0` disables the hooks but not the MCP tools;
  `OPENVIKING_MCP_URL` has no effect on this plugin.
