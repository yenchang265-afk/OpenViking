 * stdio -> streamable-HTTP MCP proxy for the Business Data Platform DSH bundle.
 *
 * DSH's MCP bridge starts this process as a local stdio MCP server. The proxy
 * resolves its connection through the same `resolveConfig()` as the in-process
 * runtime, from the child environment the bundle builds in `mcp.mjs`: DSH
 * scrubs credential-shaped names out of what it inherits, and values that came
 * from the Cordis patch are invisible to a subprocess otherwise.
