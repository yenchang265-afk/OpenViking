/**
 * One module writes the Business Data Platform request headers.
 *
 * Every harness used to spell the header block out for itself, and they
 * drifted: one named the operator to every proxy on the path whether or not the
 * server was trusted with it, one sent the api key twice, one read a different
 * field for the same account. `wire-headers.test.mjs` pins what goes out;
 * this pins that there is only one place left that can change it.
 *
 * `X-OpenViking-Actor-Peer` stands in for the whole block: it is the header a
 * hand-rolled stack cannot avoid writing, so a new one shows up here the day it
 * is added. Prose may name it freely — this reads source only.
 *
 * openclaw is deliberately out of scope; it does not share this stack yet.
