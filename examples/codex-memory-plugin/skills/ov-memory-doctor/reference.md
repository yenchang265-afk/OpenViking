# Business Data Platform Memory Doctor (Codex) — reference

Companion to SKILL.md: where things live, what the exact error strings mean,
and the symptom catalogue. Paths assume the defaults; `OPENVIKING_CONFIG_FILE`,
`OPENVIKING_CLI_CONFIG_FILE`, `OPENVIKING_DEBUG_LOG`, `OPENVIKING_CODEX_STATE_DIR`
and `CODEX_CONFIG_FILE` relocate individual pieces.

## Where things live

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `~/.openviking/ovcli.conf` | Client connection: `url`, `api_key`, `account`, `user`, optional `plugin.codex.*` tuning. Mode 0600. |
| `~/.openviking/ov.conf` | Server config. The plugin reads only `server.url/host/port`, `server.root_api_key` (last-resort key) and the legacy `codex` block. |
| `~/.openviking/ovcli.conf.<name>` | Saved CLI profiles (`ov config switch` copies one over `ovcli.conf`). `ovcli.conf.bak.<epoch>` are installer backups. |
| `<repo root>/.openviking/config.json` / `config.local.json` | Workspace config layers, `version: 1` required: `peer.source`, `peer.id`, `recall.*`, `capture.*`, `bypass.session_patterns`, `labels`. `config.json` is committed and shared; `config.local.json` is private and gitignored. Trusted without a prompt, but connection and credential keys (`url`, `api_key`, `account`, `user`, `extra_headers`, …) are stripped with a warning and `${VAR}` is never expanded. A blanket `.openviking/` rule in `.gitignore` stops `config.json` from ever being committed — narrow it to `.openviking/media/` and `.openviking/downloads/`. |
| `~/.openviking/workspaces/<slot>.json` | Per-machine workspace registry, one file per workspace (`<dir name>-<hash>.json`, mode 0600). Outranks both workspace files, and nothing writes it — a user creates the file by hand. An entry recorded for a different repository is ignored, not inherited. |
| `~/.codex/config.toml` | `[features] hooks` (or legacy `plugin_hooks`), `[plugins."openviking-memory@openviking"] enabled`, `[marketplaces.openviking]` (source, ref), `[hooks.state."openviking-memory@openviking:hooks/hooks.json:<event>:0:0"] trusted_hash` for `session_start`, `user_prompt_submit`, `pre_tool_use`, `stop`, `session_end`, `pre_compact`. |
| `~/.codex/plugins/cache/openviking/openviking-memory/<version>/` | The copy Codex runs hooks from. Keyed by `plugin.json` version. |
| `~/.codex/.tmp/marketplaces/openviking/` | Git clone of the marketplace (GitHub/TOS dist); `examples/codex-memory-plugin` inside it is what `codex plugin list` reports as the source path. |
| `~/.openviking/codex-plugin-state/<session_id>.json` | Per-session state: `ovSessionId` (`cx-<session_id>`, null once committed), `transcriptPath` (last rollout seen, used by the SessionStart sweep to catch up unsent turns), `capturedTurnCount`, `lastUpdatedAt`. |
| `~/.openviking/codex-plugin-state/<session_id>.ended.<timestamp>` / `.lock` | Sidecars: `.ended.<timestamp>` marks a thread whose SessionEnd fired but whose commit has not succeeded yet (the timestamp is in the filename so a conditional removal cannot delete a newer exit's marker; a bare `.ended` is a pre-0.8.1 leftover); `.lock` is the directory lock serializing the capture hooks. |
| `~/.openviking/codex-plugin-state/recall-compressor-profile.json` | Cached local-compressor detection (`profile.enabled`, `model`, `source`). |
| `~/.openviking/logs/codex-hooks.log` | JSONL hook + proxy log; written only when `OPENVIKING_DEBUG=1` or `codex.debug: true`. |
| `~/.openviking/codex-plugin.rc.sh`, `~/.openviking/codex-memory-plugin/runtime/` | Residue of the pre-marketplace installer. The rc script, if still sourced, exports `OPENVIKING_*` and pins credentials to env mode. |

## Config resolution

`OPENVIKING_CREDENTIAL_SOURCE` picks the mode: `env` (env vars only, neither file), `cli`
(ovcli.conf only — env and ov.conf ignored), default `auto` (env vars win when
any credential var is set, else ovcli.conf, else ov.conf/defaults). The
doctor prints the effective mode as `credential source`.

| Field | Order (auto mode) |
|---|---|
| url | `OPENVIKING_URL` → `OPENVIKING_BASE_URL` → `ovcli.conf url` → `ov.conf server.url` → `http://{server.host\|127.0.0.1}:{server.port\|1933}` |
| api_key | `OPENVIKING_BEARER_TOKEN` → `OPENVIKING_API_KEY` → `ovcli.conf api_key` → `ovcli.conf plugin.codex.apiKey` → `ovcli.conf plugin.apiKey` → `ov.conf codex.apiKey` → `ov.conf server.root_api_key` |
| account / user | `OPENVIKING_ACCOUNT` / `OPENVIKING_USER` → `ovcli.conf account/account_id`, `user/user_id` → `ovcli.conf plugin.codex.accountId/userId` → `ovcli.conf plugin.accountId/userId` → `ov.conf codex.accountId/userId` |
| peer | `OPENVIKING_PEER_ID` → registry → `config.local.json` → `config.json` (`peer.id`) → `ovcli.conf plugin.codex.peerId` → `ovcli.conf plugin.peerId` → `ovcli.conf actor_peer_id/peer_id` → `ov.conf codex.peerId` → derived per `peer.source` unless `OPENVIKING_WORKSPACE_PEER=0` |
| peer.source | `OPENVIKING_PEER_SOURCE` → registry → `config.local.json` → `config.json` → `ovcli.conf plugin.codex.peerSource` → `ovcli.conf plugin.peerSource` → `ov.conf codex.peerSource` → `git` |
| auth mode | `OPENVIKING_AUTH_MODE` → `ovcli.conf plugin.codex.authMode` → `ovcli.conf plugin.authMode` → `ov.conf codex.authMode` → `ov.conf server.auth_mode` → `trusted` when account/user are set, else `api_key` |
| tuning | env → registry → `config.local.json` → `config.json` → `ovcli.conf plugin.codex.*` → `ovcli.conf plugin.*` → `ov.conf codex.*` → defaults |

When ovcli.conf names a url, key, identity or peer and no credential variable is set, the chain is pinned to that file: the credential variables are skipped, `api_key` still falls back to `plugin.codex.apiKey` → `plugin.apiKey` → `ov.conf codex.apiKey` but never to `server.root_api_key`, and account/user stop at the `plugin` keys. The MCP proxy resolves this same chain from the variables `.mcp.json` forwards.

`peer.source` decides the derivation. `git` (the default) is the template list `["{git_remote}", "{git_root}"]`: the normalized origin URL (`git@github.com:volcengine/OpenViking.git` → `github.com-volcengine-openviking`, userinfo dropped so an embedded token can never reach the id), else the repository root path (the legacy `[^A-Za-z0-9] → -` rule), else nothing — outside a git repository no peer is sent at all, and what is remembered there goes to the user-level space. `{cwd}` is still a variable but sits in no default chain, and `{dir}` is the workspace root's directory name, empty when the directory is not a workspace. `cwd` is that legacy rule alone (the pre-git behaviour); `none` sends no peer, which is also what `OPENVIKING_WORKSPACE_PEER=0` means. Anything else is a template, or a list of templates tried in order (`"git-{git_remote}"`, `["team-{dir}", "{cwd}"]`); a template naming an empty variable falls through to the next. Derivation is filesystem-only — no `git` subprocess, which also keeps it inside the hook budgets below — so it survives a missing `git` and a dubious-ownership refusal; worktrees converge through `commondir`, a submodule keeps its own identity, and `$HOME` and `/` are never workspace roots. Every clone of one repository shares one peer; a fork's origin differs, so it stays separate, and `gh pr checkout` does not change origin.

Peers minted before this need no migration: the old cwd-derived id is recomputed locally, `peer_scope: "all"` already sweeps it, and under `"actor"` recall asks it separately. Doctor prints it as `previous peer`. Across the workspace layers lists union rather than replace, with a leading `"!reset"` dropping what the lower layers contributed; unknown keys are kept and ignored, and a file declaring a version other than `1` is skipped with a warning.

There is no global kill switch: `OPENVIKING_MEMORY_ENABLED` is ignored by the
Codex plugin. Disable features with `OPENVIKING_AUTO_RECALL=0`,
`OPENVIKING_AUTO_CAPTURE=0`, `OPENVIKING_NO_AUTO_INJECT=1`, or the plugin via
`codex plugin remove openviking-memory@openviking` / `enabled = false`.

Hook budgets in `hooks/hooks.json`: SessionStart 70s, UserPromptSubmit 130s,
PreToolUse 5s (`Bash` only, the `viking://` notice), Stop 30s, SessionEnd 3s
(Codex clamps it there; the hook detaches a worker), PreCompact 60s.
`recallTimeoutMs` (default 120000) must stay below 130s and `captureTimeoutMs`
(default 30000) at or below 30s.

Sent headers: `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, `X-OpenViking-Account/User` (trusted
mode only), `X-OpenViking-Actor-Peer`, `User-Agent: openviking-memory-codex/<version>`.
The plugin never sends `X-API-Key`. The open-source server still accepts it (and
prefers it when both are sent), so a gateway that injects one shadows the key
here; the Volcengine-hosted Business Data Platform Service (`https://api.vikingdb.cn-beijing.volces.com/openviking`) accepts Bearer only.

The doctor checks explicit `features.hooks` first, then the live `hooks` entry
from `codex features list`. Legacy `plugin_hooks` only decides the result when
neither supplies a modern feature state. An unavailable probe with no configured
flag is informational; a live enabled result needs no configuration change.

## Peer: giving a directory its own memory

```json
{"version": 1, "peer": {"id": "my-project"}}
```

Stored as `.openviking/config.json` in the directory to be named; that directory and everything below it then writes to that peer, repository or not.

| What the user says | What to do |
|---|---|
| "make this folder remember separately" | Write `peer.id` in `.openviking/config.json` in that folder |
| "these two repos should share memory" | Write the same `peer.id` in `.openviking/config.json` in both |
| "only recall this project's memories" | Set `recall.peer_scope` to `"actor"` in the same file |
| "go back to the old per-directory behaviour" | `peer.source: "cwd"` in the same file, or `OPENVIKING_PEER_SOURCE=cwd` for every directory on this machine |
| "do not separate by project at all" | `peer.source: "none"` in the same file |

That file and the registry file whose path the doctor prints are the whole surface. No `ov` subcommand creates, renames or merges a peer. Changing the id moves no existing memory: the cross-peer sweep under `peer_scope: "all"` still reaches what was written before, and under `"actor"` the extra query still reaches the pre-git cwd-derived id.

## Server auth modes (from `GET /health` → `auth_mode`)

| Mode | Credential | Identity |
|---|---|---|
| `dev` | none needed, any key accepted | `X-OpenViking-Account/User` headers, else `default`; role root |
| `api_key` | key required | from the key; account/user headers are silently stripped |
| `trusted` | root key optional | from the headers; missing → 400 `Trusted mode requests must include X-OpenViking-Account …` |

Key formats: `base64url(account).base64url(user).base64url(secret)` (three
segments, identity readable) or a bare 64-hex legacy key. Both fail
identically as `401 Invalid API Key` when unknown — there is no "wrong
account" error.

`role: root` keys are refused on everything the plugin uses (`/api/v1/sessions`,
`/api/v1/search`, `/api/v1/fs`, `/mcp`) with
`403 ROOT API keys cannot access tenant-scoped data APIs in api_key mode`.

## Error strings

Server (REST): `{"status":"error","error":{"code":…,"message":…}}`

| HTTP | code | message | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 401 | UNAUTHENTICATED | `Missing API Key when resolving identity.` | No credential reached the server (gateway stripped `Authorization`, or `bearer` lowercase) |
| 401 | UNAUTHENTICATED | `Invalid API Key` | Unknown/revoked key, or a well-formed key for a non-existent account/user |
| 403 | PERMISSION_DENIED | `ROOT API keys cannot access tenant-scoped data APIs …` | Root key used as the plugin key |
| 403 | PERMISSION_DENIED | `Requires role: …` | Key valid, role too low for that route |
| 400 | INVALID_ARGUMENT | `Trusted mode requests must include X-OpenViking-Account …` | Trusted mode without account/user |
| 412 | FAILED_PRECONDITION | `User deletion is in progress` | The user is being deleted |

`/mcp` directly: `406 Not Acceptable: Client must accept both application/json and text/event-stream`;
`400` plain text `Invalid Content-Type header`; `401/403` as JSON-RPC `-32001`
with the server message; `404` → no MCP endpoint at that url.

Plugin MCP proxy (what Codex shows for a failing tool call):

| JSON-RPC | Message | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `-32001` | `Business Data Platform MCP authentication failed (HTTP 401\|403). Check ~/.openviking/ovcli.conf or OPENVIKING_API_KEY …` | Credentials; `data.serverMessage` carries the server text |
| `-32001` | `Business Data Platform MCP request failed. Check the configured URL (<mcpUrl>) …` | Transport: `data.cause` = `fetch failed` (refused/DNS/TLS), `This operation was aborted` (timeout). The url in the message is the one actually used. |
| `-32002` | `Business Data Platform MCP upstream returned HTTP <n>.` | Any other status; HTML in `data.serverMessage` means the url is not a Business Data Platform endpoint |
| `-32003` | `Business Data Platform MCP upstream returned an empty response` | 2xx with blank/non-JSON body — captive portal or proxy interstitial |

Hook log (`codex-hooks.log`) hooks: `session-start`, `auto-recall`,
`auto-capture`, `session-end`, `pre-compact`, `mcp-proxy`. Stages worth grepping:
`health_check`, `appended`, `pending_tokens`, `commit`, `recall_context_assembled`,
`mcp-proxy` `start` (resolved `mcpUrl`, `hasApiKey` = present, not valid),
`uncaught`. Ordinary failed proxy requests are not logged — the JSON-RPC error
on stdout is the artifact.

## Local server (loopback url only)

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `~/.openviking/ov.conf` (or `OPENVIKING_CONFIG_FILE`, then `/etc/openviking/ov.conf`) | The server's config. The doctor checks the copy the plugin resolves for plugin-only keys; a server started with another `--config` runs from that file instead. |
| `<storage.workspace>/` | Data: `viking/` (content), `vectordb/context/` (index), `_system/queue/queue.db`. `storage.workspace` defaults to `./data` relative to the server's cwd. |
| `<workspace>/log/openviking.log` | Only with `log.output: "file"`. Default is stdout (terminal / tmux / nohup file / `journalctl -u openviking` / `docker logs openviking`). Time-rotated as `openviking.log.YYYY-MM-DD`. |
| docker | Container `openviking`, image `ghcr.io/volcengine/openviking`, `~/.openviking` mounted at `/app/.openviking` (config, ovcli.conf and data). `docker exec openviking openviking-server doctor` works. |

Process: `<python> -E …/bin/openviking-server` — match `openviking-server` in
the command line, never the process name (`Python`). Default bind
`127.0.0.1:1933`; `--host`/`--port` override `server.host`/`server.port`. The
port is bound only after initialization finishes, so "connection refused"
during startup is normal; `/health` 200 says nothing about embedding or VLM.

`GET /ready` (no auth, 200 or 503):
`{"status":"ready"|"not_ready","checks":{"agfs":{"status":…,"checks":{"filesystem":…,"multiwrite_sync":…}},"vectordb":…,"api_key_manager":…,"embedding":…,"ollama":…}}`.
`ok`, `not_configured` and `not_supported` count as healthy; `embedding` is a
real embed call with a 10s cap. `503 {"status":"not_ready","reason":"initializing"}`
while booting; 404 on servers that predate the endpoint. The official docker
image answers every route with `503 {"status":"pending_initialization", "fix":[…]}`
until it has an ov.conf.

Startup failures (printed by the server; exit 1 unless noted):

| Text | Cause |
|---|---|
| `Business Data Platform configuration file not found.` | No ov.conf at any resolved path |
| `Unknown config field '…' in OpenVikingConfig` / `Extra inputs are not permitted` | Unknown key — including a top-level block named after any harness (`claude_code`, `codex`, `cursor`, `trae`, `trae_cn`, `zcode`, `opencode`, `dsh`, `pi`) and `server.url`, which only the plugins read |
| `SECURITY: server.auth_mode='dev' requires server.host to be localhost` | Dev mode (no `auth_mode`, no `root_api_key`) on a non-loopback bind |
| `Invalid server.root_api_key: empty string is not allowed` | `""` instead of `null` |
| `Another Business Data Platform process is already using the data directory` | Two servers on one workspace (exit 3, `Application startup failed. Exiting.`) |
| `EmbeddingRebuildRequiredError` / `embedding dimension (…) does not match current configuration` | Embedding model changed on an existing workspace (exit 3) |
| `[Errno 48] / [Errno 98] Address already in use` | Port taken — `lsof -nP -iTCP:1933 -sTCP:LISTEN` |
| `FATAL: AUTHENTICATION HEALTH CHECK FAILED` | OIDC/LDAP backend unreachable |

Runtime signatures in the server log: `Dimension mismatch` (config), `Dense
vector dimension mismatch` (writes dropped), `Credential … failed with auth`
and `Backup VLM also failed` (VLM key), `Embedding circuit breaker is open`
(provider down, messages re-queued).

`openviking-server doctor` (same as `ov doctor`) checks Config, Python,
Native Engine, AGFS, Authentication, Embedding (live probe), VLM (key presence
only), Ollama, VikingBot and Disk. Text only, exit 1 on FAIL, needs the
server's Python environment; the bare Rust `ov` binary (npm / cargo install)
reports `unknown command`.

## Symptom catalogue

| Symptom | Likely cause | Detect | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| Plugin listed and enabled, but no `<openviking-context>` ever, no log | `hooks` / `plugin_hooks` off, hooks never trusted, or no parseable config | doctor Plugin install + Configuration sections | Enable hooks / approve the prompt / fix config |
| Worked until an edit to `ovcli.conf` | JSON broken by the edit | doctor "cannot be parsed" | Fix JSON |
| Edits to `ovcli.conf` or `ov config switch` have no effect | Env var or rc-file export wins (`credential source: env`) | doctor "← env"; `env \| grep OPENVIKING_` | Remove the export |
| Recall empty on a healthy server | Wrong key (401 reads as no results), wrong user space, peer scope, threshold | `/health` with key; `/api/v1/system/status` → `result.user` | Fix key; `OPENVIKING_PEER_ID`; lower `OPENVIKING_SCORE_THRESHOLD` |
| Recall empty after moving/renaming the repo | Mostly gone: the peer follows `origin`, so a move, rename, worktree or fresh clone keeps it. What still changes identity is a repository with no origin, which falls back to the root path | doctor `peer … ← workspace (…)` — `{git_remote}` is move-proof, `{git_root}` is not; `previous peer` names the id left behind | `git remote add origin …`, or pin `peer.id` in `.openviking/config.json` / `OPENVIKING_PEER_ID` |
| No project memory in a directory that is not a repository | By design: no `.git` and no `.openviking/config.json` above it means no peer, so those memories are in the user-level space | doctor Workspace section: `not a workspace: …` | Create `.openviking/config.json` there with a `peer.id`, or leave it as it is |
| Recall or capture dead in one repository only | A committed `.openviking/config.json` turns `recall.enabled` / `capture.enabled` off, or changes `peer.source` | doctor Workspace section: `<key> = … ← config.json (workspace)` plus the announcement warning | Override in `.openviking/config.local.json` or `~/.openviking/workspaces/<slot>.json` |
| Hooks stopped after a plugin update | `hooks.json` hash changed; Codex re-prompts for trust | doctor "hooks without a trust record" | Accept the prompt in a new session |
| MCP tools missing | `.mcp.json` not loaded (plugin disabled), node missing, or `/mcp` not proxied | doctor Connection `/mcp` probe | Fix enablement / node / reverse proxy |
| Everything duplicated | Two plugin ids installed (legacy `openviking-plugins-local`) | doctor "more than one copy" | `codex plugin remove <stale id>` |
| `codex plugin marketplace upgrade` says up to date but bug persists | Version-keyed cache, version string unchanged | doctor cache versions vs marketplace copy | Re-run the installer (re-registers the marketplace) |
| Every prompt is slow | Local compressor (`codex exec`) on each recall | `recall-compressor-profile.json`; `OPENVIKING_RECALL_COMPRESS=0` to test | Disable compression or fix the model |
| curl works, plugin says offline | Corporate proxy or private CA; Node ignores both | doctor proxy/TLS hints; `node -e "fetch('<url>/health')"` | `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1` / `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` in the launching environment |
| `0 memories extracted` / commits never produce memories | VLM missing or failing, or embedding failing on the server | doctor `/ready: embedding`; ov.conf without a `vlm` section; server log `Backup VLM also failed` / `Credential … failed with auth` | Fix vlm/embedding in ov.conf, restart the server |
| "server unreachable" right after editing ov.conf | The server exited at its restart because of the edit | doctor Server health lint; the startup text in the server's terminal | Fix the finding, start it again |
| Recall empty and the index never grows after switching the embedding model | Dimension mismatch — every vector write is dropped | startup `EmbeddingRebuildRequiredError`, or log `Dense vector dimension mismatch` while it still runs | Original model, or a fresh workspace |
