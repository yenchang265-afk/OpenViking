"""Tests for Windows-reserved-name safety in resource URI segments.

Mirrors the Win32 device-name guard that PR #4517 added to the memory path
(``openviking/session/memory/utils/uri.py``) onto the resource path's
``VikingURI.sanitize_segment``. A segment whose stem is a Win32 reserved
name (``CON``, ``PRN``, ``NUL``, ``AUX``, ``COM1``..``COM9``,
``LPT1``..``LPT9``) is prefixed with ``_`` so it does not collide with a
Windows device name and cause a silent write failure.
