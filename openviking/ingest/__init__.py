"""Conversation-log ingest: replay local agent-harness logs into Business Data Platform sessions.

Parses each harness's local conversation logs (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Hermes,
OpenClaw, Cursor) into normalized messages and replays them through OV's existing
``create_session -> batch_add_messages -> commit`` pipeline (commit triggers OV's
async memory extraction). Supports one-shot backfill of existing logs and
incremental, cursor-driven polling of new logs.

Inspired by / supersedes volcengine/OpenViking#2674 by @huang-yi-dae.
