"""Connector source-type detection shared by routing and input guards.

Detection mirrors the standard pipeline's own routing (accessor
``can_handle`` predicates) instead of raw URL schemes, so a Connector
add_type matches exactly the sources its plugin can import: ``tos`` by the
``tos://`` prefix, ``git`` by the same repository-URL predicate the
standard ``GitAccessor`` uses (``git@``/``ssh://``/``git://`` and code
hosting ``http(s)`` URLs).
