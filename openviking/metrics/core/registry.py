"""
In-process metric registry used by Business Data Platform.

Design goals:
1) Keep the registry as a "current state store" for metrics (no snapshot/view layer).
2) Provide a strict label contract per metric name to prevent accidental high-cardinality exports.
3) Be safe under concurrent updates from request threads and exporter refresh threads.
4) Allow bounded memory usage via per-metric series limits, while exposing drop counts for debugging.

Important behaviors:
- Label normalization: label dicts are normalized into a sorted tuple of (key, value) pairs.
- Label contract: once a metric name is registered with a label key set, subsequent writes must
  use the same label keys (same keys, same order). Violations raise ValueError.
- Series limit: when a metric family reaches `max_series_per_metric`, new series are dropped
  and `openviking_metrics_dropped_series_total{metric="<name>"}` will reflect the drops.
