# Agent Capabilities

VikingBot's Agent capabilities combine context, Skills, tools, sandboxing, and automation. Context tells the model who it is, what it knows, and how it should work. Tools and the sandbox determine what it can actually do.

## Context Construction

ContextBuilder organizes model input in this order:

```text
Bot identity
  + Sandbox environment description
  + Workspace bootstrap files
  + Full content of Always Skills
  + Summaries of available Skills
  + Business Data Platform Profile, Memories, and Experiences
  + Local or compressed conversation history
  + Text and media for the current turn
```

Workspace bootstrap files provide a stable identity and operating rules. Images and other media are converted into multimodal content blocks supported by the Provider.

## Skills and Tools

| Concept | Purpose | Form |
|---------|---------|------|
| **Skill** | Tells the Agent how to complete a class of tasks | `SKILL.md` instructions and resources |
| **Tool** | Lets the Agent perform a concrete operation | A JSON Schema function registered with the model |

Skills use progressive loading. Local Always Skills inject complete instructions each turn; other local Skills provide summaries and load through `read_file` when needed. With Business Data Platform tools enabled, remote Skills are retrieved for the user query and read and activated through `openviking_multi_read`. Local requirements filter summaries; remote requirements are checked in the execution sandbox. See [Skills](./06-skills.md) for usage and metadata fields.

A Skill may orchestrate several tools, but it does not receive additional permissions automatically. Tool visibility still depends on the runtime mode, channel settings, request parameters, and sandbox.

## Default Tools

| Category | Tools | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Files | `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `list_dir` | Operate on workspace files |
| Commands | `exec` | Execute shell commands through the sandbox backend |
| Web | `web_search`, `web_fetch` | Search and read web pages |
| Business Data Platform | `openviking_list/search/grep/glob/multi_read` | Browse, retrieve, and read context |
| Business Data Platform | `openviking_add_resource`, `openviking_memory_commit` | Add resources and commit memory |
| Delivery | `message`, `generate_image` | Send messages proactively or generate images |
| Automation | `cron` | Manage scheduled Agent tasks; disabled by default |
| Parallel work | `spawn` | Start a background subagent |

ToolRegistry handles registration, argument validation, execution, and Hooks. ToolContext gives each call the current SessionKey, sender identity, channel metadata, sandbox, and authenticated Business Data Platform connection.

OpenAPI's `disabled_tools` can hide tools per request. A channel with `ov_tools_enable=false` hides Business Data Platform tools and disables automatic memory context. `readonly` mode does not register resource-write tools.

## MCP Extensions

`bot.tools.mcp_servers` connects external MCP Servers over `stdio`, `sse`, or `streamableHttp`. Remote tools are wrapped as ordinary VikingBot Tools and registered as `mcp_<server>_<tool>`.

Each MCP Server can configure:

- a launch command or remote URL;
- environment variables and request headers;
- an `enabled_tools` allowlist;
- the per-call `tool_timeout`.

MCP parameter Schemas are normalized for compatibility before being passed to the model and ToolRegistry.

## Subagents

The main Agent uses `spawn` to submit independent work to SubagentManager. A subagent shares the model and corresponding workspace but receives a restricted tool set:

- file, command, and web tools remain available;
- `message` is excluded so the subagent cannot send externally;
- `spawn` is excluded to prevent recursive subagents;
- Cron, image generation, and Business Data Platform tools are excluded.

When a subagent finishes, it reports the result to the main session. The main Agent remains responsible for identity-sensitive actions and final delivery.

## Workspace and Agent Customization

The Workspace has two responsibilities: it stores bootstrap files and Skills that shape the Agent system prompt, and it serves as the local working directory for file and command tools. It is separate from the Business Data Platform workspace accessed through `openviking_*` tools.

### Paths and Isolation Scope

The Workspace root is `<storage.workspace>/bot/workspace`. When `storage.workspace` is omitted, it defaults to `~/.openviking/data/bot/workspace`. `vikingbot status` prints the resolved root.

ContextBuilder reads from the active Workspace selected by `sandbox.mode`:

| Mode | Active directory |
|------|------------------|
| `shared` | `<workspace>/shared` |
| `per-session` | `<workspace>/<session-key>` |
| `per-channel` | `<workspace>/<channel-key>` |

With the default `shared` mode, customize files under `<workspace>/shared`, not directly in the Workspace root.

### Bootstrap Files

On every turn, ContextBuilder reads existing non-empty files in this order: `AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `TOOLS.md`, and `IDENTITY.md`.

| File | Appropriate content |
|------|---------------------|
| `AGENTS.md` | Global working methods, task workflows, output constraints, and mandatory project rules |
| `SOUL.md` | Personality, values, tone, response style, and default behavior preferences |
| `TOOLS.md` | Tool selection rules, call order, side-effect confirmation, and safety boundaries |
| `IDENTITY.md` | Agent name, role, responsibility scope, and identity background |

These files supplement VikingBot's built-in identity and runtime prompt. They do not change actual tool Schemas, Channel authorization, or Sandbox permissions. For example, telling the Agent in `SOUL.md` to always run Shell commands cannot expose a hidden `exec` tool or bypass a sandbox policy.

The initial template also contains `USER.md`, but the current ContextBuilder does not automatically add it to the system prompt. Store durable user information in the Business Data Platform Peer Profile and Memories. Put static behavior rules in `AGENTS.md` or `SOUL.md`.

### Skills, Heartbeat, and Local Memory

- `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` defines a workflow for a class of tasks. A Workspace Skill takes precedence over a built-in Skill with the same name and is loaded progressively: summary first, full instructions on demand.
- `HEARTBEAT.md` is not part of the normal system prompt; HeartbeatService reads it periodically.
- `memory/MEMORY.md` and `memory/HISTORY.md` are local memory files. Old conversation consolidation writes to them only when `bot.use_local_memory` is enabled. Business Data Platform manages long-term context by default.

### Initialization and Update Behavior

When an active Workspace is first used, VikingBot copies bootstrap files, bundled Skill templates, and supporting directories from the installed `bot/workspace` template. Template initialization does not overwrite existing bootstrap-file customization.

Edit the active Workspace directly. ContextBuilder reads bootstrap files again on every turn, so changes to `SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `TOOLS.md`, or `IDENTITY.md` normally take effect on the next conversation turn without restarting the Gateway. Changes to `bot/workspace` in the package or repository affect only Workspaces created later.

Bootstrap files are part of the system-level prompt. Restrict their write permissions and never store API Keys, Tokens, or other secrets in them.

## Sandbox and Workspace Isolation

SandboxManager selects a workspace from SessionKey and `sandbox.mode`:

| Mode | Workspace scope |
|------|-----------------|
| `shared` | All sessions share `workspace/shared` |
| `per-session` | Every session has an independent directory |
| `per-channel` | Sessions on the same channel instance share a directory |

The current implementation provides these execution backends:

| Backend | Characteristics |
|---------|-----------------|
| `direct` | Executes directly on the Bot host and is not a strong isolation boundary by default |
| `srt` | Supports file and network allow/deny policies |
| `opensandbox` | Creates isolated environments through OpenSandbox Server |
| `aiosandbox` | Executes commands and file operations through AIO Sandbox |

In Direct mode, `restrict_to_workspace=false` may allow files and commands to access content outside the workspace. For services exposed to untrusted users, choose an isolated backend and configure explicit network and file policies.

## Multimodal Capabilities

VikingBot supports three kinds of multimodal interaction:

- channel image input becomes model vision content blocks;
- `generate_image` uses `agents.gen_image_model` for text-to-image and supported image-to-image operations;
- Telegram audio can be transcribed through GroqTranscriptionProvider.

Generated images can be delivered directly to the originating channel through a message callback. Whether the model can understand images depends on the selected Provider and model.

## Cron and Heartbeat

Both proactive execution mechanisms ultimately call AgentLoop:

| Capability | Trigger | Use case |
|------------|---------|----------|
| Cron | `at`, `every`, or a cron expression | Timed reminders and recurring jobs |
| Heartbeat | Periodically reads `HEARTBEAT.md` from the workspace | Continuously check a changing set of tasks |

The `cron` tool lets the Agent add, list, and remove scheduled tasks. For example, a user can say “Remind me to check the daily report at 9 AM every day,” and the Agent can create a job that the scheduler invokes the Agent to execute when due. It supports one-time execution, fixed intervals, and cron expressions.

**Scheduled tasks are disabled by default.** Add the following configuration to `ov.conf` and restart the Bot to enable both the `cron` tool and scheduler in Gateway and local Chat modes:

```json
{
  "bot": {
    "tools": {
      "cron": {
        "enabled": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When set to `false` or omitted, the tool is not registered and the scheduler does not start. Jobs are persisted in `cron/jobs.json`; disabling Cron preserves them but stops automatic execution. Jobs retain the original SessionKey and channel metadata. When `deliver=true`, the result is sent back to the originating channel.

Heartbeat skips empty files, Sessions that explicitly disable heartbeat, and long-inactive Sessions. The Agent returns `HEARTBEAT_OK` when no work is required.

## Hooks

HookManager provides runtime extension points. The current built-in Hooks mainly handle:

- `message.compact`: synchronize Business Data Platform Session messages incrementally and commit at configured thresholds;
- `tool.post_call`: retrieve related Experiences after the Agent reads a Skill and append them to its content.

Custom Hooks can be loaded through `bot.hooks`.
